The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not
available.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv
package using the following command.
    apt install python3.10-venv
You may need to use sudo with that command.  After installing the python3-venv
package, recreate your virtual environment.
